### Project Description

This is a website that connects people who live in New York State to local mental health programs and other human services organizations. A user will type in the their city name, and then the [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/) library that is integrated in this website, will plot out available orgainizations on the map. From there a user can click on the markers or look at the information bar which will list the same data. The data will consist of titles, descriptions, and phone numbers. 

### API and Data Sample

The main API that I will be using is the [Local Mental Health Programs API](https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Local-Mental-Health-Programs/6nvr-tbv8) provided by [New York State](https://data.ny.gov/). The Parameter I will be passing into the get request will be `program_city=Cityname`. The cities first letter must be capitalized for a succesful request. If succesful the request will return data in a JSON format. 

*Please note: The second JSON object does not contain latitude and longitude. Unfortunetely at this time those entries will not be listed on this site. However this is not the norm, the majority of the objects will contain this data.*

### MVP 
*Minimum Viable Product*
- Mobile first design with media queries to change content layout for mobile vs desktop users. 
- Add a search bar for the user to input a city name.
- Render a map centering on New York State using the [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/) library.
- Make an API call using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to New York Stateâ€™s  [Local Mental Health Programs API](https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Local-Mental-Health-Programs/6nvr-tbv8)  using the city name the user entered. 
- Use returned data's latitude and longitudes fields to populate the map with markers.
- Display program names, descriptions, catogories, and contact information on cards next to the map. 
- Display the same info except in a pop-up after you click a marker. 


### PostMVP  
*Features that will help create a better expierence and better website. 
- Light and dark modes.
- Hover effect on markers when mouse is on the cards.
- Map animation to zoom in on selected city. 
- Hover effect on cards.
- Create algo to display the ```"human_address": "{\"address\": \"4 21 27th Avenue\", \"city\": \"Astoria\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"zip\": \"11102-4510\"}"``` field to add more content to the cards and pop-ups.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
